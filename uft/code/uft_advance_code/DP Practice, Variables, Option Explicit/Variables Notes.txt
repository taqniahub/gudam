'************************VARIABLES******************************************
'WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
'=> It's a container that is used to hold a SINGLE value (numbers, letters, or numbers & letters)

'=> A variable is a name that is assigned to a location in your computer's memory where the data used by UFT is stored

'=> Example:
'		- We create a variable named 'AGE' that UFT uses to store an Integer value of "25"
'		- The Variable (named 'AGE') is simply a pointer to a location in the memory where the value "25" is stored

'=> VBScript does not require that you DECLARE a variable before using it, but it is a good practice to do so

'DECLARING A VARIABLE - 

'=> DIM Statement: Declares variables and allocates storage space
'=> DIM = Declare In Memory

'	=> Variables declared using DIM at the Script Level are available to ALL procedures within the script (Scope - Global)

'	=> Variables declared using DIM at the Procedure Level are available only within that procedure (Scope - Local)
'		- ***We will talk more about Variable Scope when we talk about Functions and Sub Procedures***

'	=> Example: 
'		DIM AGE => THE VARIABLE HAS BEEN DECLARED (NO VALUE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE VARIABLE YET)


'=> Other ways to declare variables: Private & Public Statements
'=> PRIVATE Statement: Declares Private Variables and allocates storage space 

'	=> Private Statement Variables are available only to the script in which they are declared

'=> PUBLIC Statement: Delcares Public Variables and allocates storage space

'	=> Public Statement Variables are available to all procedures in all scripts 

'		**We will talk more about Public and Private Statements later in the course

'=> SETTING A VALUE FOR A VARIABLE - 

'=> You can put a value into a variable by using the "Assignment Operator" (=)

'=> MyName = "Jay"
'		- MyName is blank; it is the name of the variable
'		- "Jay" is the string (the data) that is being stored as the value for MyName
'			=> Now UFT knows what you're talking about when you use the variable name "MyName"
'			=> msgbox MyName  => Will display a message box with the value Jay

'		- What is the difference between these four:
'			1. MyName
'			2. myname
'			3. MyNaame
'			4. MYNAME


'		- VBScript is NOT Case Sensitive!

'Concatenation --> To Concatenate means to Combine
'The purpose of Concatenation is to combine 2 different data points together
'Concatenator in VBScript is '&'
'& --> Ampersand


'=> Variable Naming Restrictions 

'	=> Must begin with an alphabetic character (must begin with a letter, can't begin with a number)
'	=> Must not exceed 255 characters
'	=> Must be unique in the scope in which it is declared (We'll talk more about Variable Scope when we go over Functions)
