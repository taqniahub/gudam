'******************Option Explicit*******************************************************

'What is Option Explicit?
'=> Used at script level to force EXPLICIT DECLARATION of all variables in that script.

'=> Must be the very first line in the script before any other statements

'=> All variables must be explicitly declared using the DIM, PRIVATE, PUBLIC, OR ReDIM statements


'=> VBScript creates a new variable by default if "Option Explicit" is not used for any misspelled variable name.

'	=> Example:
'		MyName = "Jay"
'		Msgbox MyNaame
'			=> The result: A message Box with a blank value 
'				WHY???
'					- Because "Option Explicit" wasn't used and so A variable named "MyNaame" was created and used in the Msgbox.
'					- You Defined the value for the variable called "MyName", but didn't use it since you used "MyNaame" instead
'					- Option Explicit will throw an error in this case if it is used
'					- If we had used Option Explicit, an error would have appeared saying "Variable is undefined: 'MyNaame'."
'					- It would also provide us with the line number so we can go directly to that line to fix the problem

'			=>NOTE - Using Option Explicit will not result in syntax errors; it will result in Run Time Errors
'					- Checking Syntax will not show you that you have misspelled a variable

'Why is it important?

'	=> Use Option Explicit to avoid incorrectly typing the name of an existing variable or to avoid confusion in code where the 
'		scope of the variable is not clear

'	=> Helps ensure that you are using your variables correctly and don't have any erroneous variables throughout your script


'Each of your scripts should include Option Explicit from now on!!
