'**************************************Looping Statements****************************

'=>There are 4 kinds of loop statements

'Each cycle is called an Iteration

'=> #1 Do...loop

'	=> This is used when a statement or block of statements need to be executed while or until a said condition is true

'	Synatx 1:

'		x = 0

'		Do While x < 5
'		Print x
'		x = x+1
'		Loop

'	Syntax 2:

'		x = 0 

'		Do 
'		Print x
'		x = x+1
'		Loop Until x = 5


'	=>Whats the Difference?
'		=>Syntax 1: The statements within the Do While loop don't get executed unless, the condition becomes true or holds true.	

'		=>Syntax 2: The statements within the loop get executed at least once and then the check is performed on the condition.


'=> #2 While...Wend

'	=> Syntax:

'		x = 0

'		While x <=5
'		Print x
'		x = x+1
'		Wend

'	=> Will perform the actions described while the condition is true

'	=> I don't normally use this, It's pretty basic, but doesn't allow for much flexibility 


'=> #3 For...Next

'=> This is the statement that you would use when you want a statement or set of statements to run a certian number of times while a certain counter gets incremented or decremented (increases or decreases)

'=> Syntax:
'			For i = start To end [step] <= this step is optional - means to increment or decrement the counter by that number (default is 1)
'				Perform
'				Some
'				Actions
'			Next 

'	=>Example: Positive Step
'				Dim k, i, total 
'				For i = 2 To 12 Step 2
'					total = total + k
'					Print Total
'				Next

'	=>Example: Negative Step
'				Dim k, i, total 
'				For i = 12 To 2 Step -2
'					total = total + k
'					Print Total
'				Next

'	=>Example: How I Usually Use For Loops
'				Dim k 
'				For i = 1 To 12
'					total = total + k
'					Print Total
'				Next
