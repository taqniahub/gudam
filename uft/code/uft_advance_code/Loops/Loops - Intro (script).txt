'For Loop:

'Positive Step:
'For i = 2 To 12 Step 2
'	Print "This is iteration Number: " & i
'Next

'Negative Step:
'For i = 12 To 2 Step -2
'	Print "This is Iteration Number: " & i
'Next

'How I normally use the For Loop:
For i = 1 To 5 'Value of i will increase by 1 if the step clause is not included
	Print "This is Iteration Nubmer: " & i
Next
