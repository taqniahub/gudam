'**************************Parameterization using MS Excel************************

'=> Understand the Excel Object Model:
'	-> Excel Application contains...
'		-> Many WORKBOOKS which contain...
'			-> Many WORKSHEETS which contain...
'				-> Many CELLS which contain...
'					-> 1 Datum (1 piece of information [1 value] - singular form of DATA)

'=> Before doing anything with MS Excel we must first CONNECT UFT with Excel
'	-> CreateObject Method
'		-> This method creates a reference (within UFT) to an application sitting on your computer
'		-> This method makes a bridge between UFT and that application
'		-> Syntax: (For Excel) 
'			Set MyExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
'				-> MyExcel is now a reference (used by UFT) to the Excel Application that is sitting on your Operating System 

'=> Create an Excel File:
'	-> THE 1ST STEP WHEN WORKING WITH EXCEL:
'		CREATE A REFERENCE WITHIN UFT TO THE EXCEL APPLICATION (CREATE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN UFT AND EXCEL)
'	Set MyExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")

'	-> To Add a New Workbook to Excel:
'		MyExcel.Workbooks.Add

'	-> Save the Excel File as UFT.xls (or UFT.xlsx)
'		MyExcel.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs "C:\UFT.xls"

'	-> Close Excel Application
'		MyExcel.Application.Quit

'	-> Release the Memory allocated for MyExcel on the computer's cache
'		Set MyExcel = Nothing

'=> Write data to an Excel File that already exists 
'	-> THE 1ST STEP WHEN WORKING WITH EXCEL IS TO CREATE THAT CONNECTION USING THE CREATEOBJECT METHOD
'		Set MyXL = CreateObject ("Excel.Application")

'	-> MyXL.Workbooks.Open "C:\UFT.xls"
'		Within the Excel Application (which is being referenced by MyXL) there are many workbooks
'		We are specifying exactly which workbook to open by putting the file path of the excel workbook we want to open

'	-> MyXL.Application.Visible = TRUE
'		This is an OPTIONAL Step
'		If we say "True" we (the tester) will be able to see the Excel Application and the workbook that is opened
'		if we say "False" we (the teser) will not be able to see the Excel Application or the workbook (but it WILL be open and running)

'	-> Set MySheet = MyXL.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets ("Sheet1")
'		Now the specific workbook we wanted to work with is open (it is now ACTIVE)
'		Within the ACTIVE WORKBOOK there are many WORKSHEETS
'		We are specifying exactly which worksheet we want to work with by putting the Sheet Name of the sheet we want UFT to reference
'		Now 'MySheet' will reference Sheet1 in the UFT.xls Workbook

'	-> Enter Values in Sheet1
'		Syntax for writing data to excel is:
'			ExcelSheetReference.Cells(row,col).Value = data
'				MySheet.Cells(1,1).Value = "First Name"
'				MySheet.Cells(1,"B").Value = "Last Name"
'				MySheet.Cells(1,3).Value = "Age"
'				MySheet.Cells(2,"A").Value = "Jay"
'				MySheet.Cells(2,2).Value = "Mathur"
'				MySheet.Cells(2,"C").Value = 27
'				MySheet.Cells(3,1).Value = "John"
'				MySheet.Cells(3,"B").Value = "Doe"
'				MySheet.Cells(3,3).Value = 20

'	-> Save the Workbook
'		MyXL.ActiveWorkbook.Save

'	-> Close Excel Application
'		MyXL.Application.Quit

'	-> Release the Memory allocated for MyXL & MySheet on the computer's cache
'		Set MyXL = Nothing
'		Set MySheet = Nothing

'=> Read data from an Excel file that already exists

'	-> THE 1ST STEP WHEN WORKING WIHT EXCEL IS TO CREATE THAT CONNECTION USING THE CREATEOBJECT METHOD
'		Set Exl = CreateObject ("Excel.Application")

'	-> Exl.Workbooks.Open "C:\UFT.xls"
'		Within the Excel Application (which is being referenced by MyXL) there are many workbooks
'		We are specifying exactly which workbook to open by putting the file path of the excel workbook we want to open

'	-> Exl.Application.Visible = TRUE
'		This is an OPTIONAL Step
'		If we say "True" we (the tester) will be able to see the Excel Application and the workbook that is opened
'		if we say "False" we (the teser) will not be able to see the Excel Application or the workbook (but it WILL be open and running)

'	-> Set Worksheet1 = MyXL.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets ("TestData")
'		Now the specific workbook we wanted to work with is open (it is now ACTIVE)
'		Within the ACTIVE WORKBOOK there are many WORKSHEETS
'		We are specifying exactly which worksheet we want to work with by putting the Sheet Name of the sheet we want UFT to reference
'		Now 'Worksheet1' will reference TestData in the UFT.xls Workbook

'	-> Read Data from the sheet named TestData and present it in the output pane
'		Print Worksheet1.cells(1,"A").Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(1,"B").Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(1,3).Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(2,1).Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(2,2).Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(2,3).Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(3,"A").Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(3,"B").Value
'		Print Worksheet1.Cells(3,"C").Value
