'*********************Environment Variables**************************

'BASICS OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
'=> Environment Variables are dynamic "objects" on a comptuer that can store a value which can be referenced by many software programs in Microsoft Windows
'=> There are many environment variables that can be referenced by programs 

'=> UFT Environment Variables can be accessed by all actions, function libraries, and recovery scenarios

'=> Types of Environment Variables
'	1. Built-In Environment Variables
'	2. User Defined Internal Environment Variables
'	3. User Defined External Environment Variables

'=> Built-In Environment Variables:
'	=> Internal Variables that are provided by UFT
'	=> Can provide valuable information such as file path of the test, name of the action/iteration, OS Version
' 	=> Can be accessed by: File --> Test Settings --> Environment Tab

'=> User Defined Environment Variables:
'	=> User Defined INTERNAL:
'		=> Defined within the Test
'		=> These variables are saved within the test and are accessible only within the test in which they were defined
'		=> To define INTERNAL Environment Variables (descriptive programming): Environment.Value("URL") = "www.edmunds.com/calculators"
'		=> To call INTERNAL Environment Variables (descriptive programming): msgbox Environment.Value("URL")
'		=> To define using UFT Test Settings: File --> Test Settings --> Environment --> Set Variable Type = User-Defined --> 
'			Click on "+" button --> Add name and value
'	=> User Defined EXTERNAL:
'		=> These are variables that we predefine in the active external environment variables file
'		=> Can be created using using a list of variable-value pairs in an external file in XML format
'		=> Can be loaded in 2 ways:
'			1. Through Test Settings
'			2. Dynamically during Run-Time
'		=> Loading External Environment Variable Files Through Test Settings:
'			=> File --> Test Settings --> Environment --> Then...
'				1. Check "Load Variables and Values from External File" box
'				2. Click the browse button and select the XML file
'				3. Environment Variables are loaded from the XML file selected and appear in the variables list

'=> Environment Variables Methods:
'	=> ExternalFileName Property: Returns the name of the loaded external environment variable file specified 
'		in the Environment Tab of the Test Run Settings
'		=> Syntax: 
'				FileName = Environment.ExternalFileName
'				Msgbox FileName
'	=> LoadFromFile Method: Loads the specified Environment Variable file (in XML format) dynamically during Run-Time
'		=> You don't need to manually add the environment variables through the Test Settings when using this method
'	=> Value Property: Retrieves the value of environment variables
'		=> Can set the value of user-defined internal environment variables using this property
