'***************************Conditional Statements********************************************

'=> Conditional Statements are used to help control the flow of your automation script

'=> Types of Conditional Statements:

'	=> If Statement:

'		If (some condition) Then
'		{Perform Some Action}
'		Else --------------->	=> Else is optional
'		{Perform Some other Action}
'		End If

'	=> Select Statement:

'		=> This is to choose 1 out of the many options depending on the condition that becomes satisfied 
'		=> The condition is evaluated once and based on the value it receives, one of the following blocks
'			of code gets chosen for execution

'		Select Case (Browser)
'		Case "IE"
'		SystemUtil.Run "iexplore.exe"
'		Case "FireFox"
'		SystemUtil.Run "Firefox.exe"
'		Case "Chrome"
'		SystemUtil.Run "Chrome.Exe"
'		End Select

'		=> In this example, "Browser" is a variable which must be defined before the Select statement
'			Browser = "IE" or Browser = "FireFox" or Browser = "Chrome"
'			=> Depending on the value that is assigned to the Browser Variable, the Select Statement will
'			   execute the appropraite block of code
