'***********************************Data Types*******************************************************

'=>VBScript has only ONE data type - it is called Variant

'=> A Variant is a special kind of data type that can contain different kinds of information, depending on how it's used

'=> A Variant can contain either string or numeric information

'=> A Variant behaves as a number when you use it in a numeric context & as a string when you use it in a string context

'	=> VBScript looks at how you're working with data; if you're working with data that looks like numbers, VBScript assumes that it's numbers and does what is most appropriate for numbers (Strings are the same way)

'		=> You can always make numbers behave like strings by using quotation marks around the numbers (" ")

'=> A Variant can make further distinctions about the specific nature of numeric information (it's able to analyze the type
'		of numeric information)

'	=> Example: Numeric information can represent a date or time. When used with other date or time information, the result
'				is always expressed as a date or a time

'=> There are several different types of numeric information that can be contained in a Variant


'=> Some Important Variant SubTypes:

'	=> Boolean - Contains Either TRUE or FALSE

'	=> Integer - Contains integer in the range -32,768 to 32,767.

'	=> String - Contains a variable-length string that can be up to approximately 2 billion characters in length.
