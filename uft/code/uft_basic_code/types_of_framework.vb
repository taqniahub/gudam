Types of Automation Frameworks in QTP
Automation framework is designed to ease the process of test automation using QTP. Automation framework helps from scalability point of view. It is very easy to automate the test cases using automation framework rather than ad hoc approach.

There are mainly 3 types of Automation Frameworks in QTP
Record and Play Back
Data Driven Framework
Keyword Driven Framework
Hybrid Framework

Record and play back Framework  :
In this Framework , User records the test steps in the application. This is very basic framework. Modular approach is not followed. Maintenance of the test scripts is time consuming and difficult.

DATA Driven Framework :
In data driven framework, importance is given to test data than multiple functionality of application. We design data driven framework to work with applications where we want to test same flow with different test data. Test data is usually stored in the excel sheet. Test steps are stored in QTP script library.

Keyword Driven Framework  : 
In Keyword Driven Framework , Importance is given to functions than Test Data. when we have to test multiple functionality we can go for keyword frameworks. Each keyword is mapped to function in QTP library and application. Test data and test steps are stored in the excel file.

Hybrid Framework -
This is the combination of keyword and data driven frameworks.

After analyzing the  application, you can decide what kind of framework best suits your needs and then you can design automation framework in QTP.
