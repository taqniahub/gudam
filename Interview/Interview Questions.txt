1. What are some Exit Criteria you include in your test plans?
	- 100% test coverage (all tests have been executed)
	- No open bugs with High or Medium severity
	- <2% of low severity bugs are still open
	- <95% of the requirements are bug-free
	- Project timelines have ended
	- Budget is finished

2. Explain how Scrum is implemented at your current project
	- Our sprints are 2 weeks long
	- My scrum team consists of 8 people
		- 1 Product Owner
		- 1 Scrum Master
		- 2 Testers
		- 4 Developers
	- At the beginning of our sprints, we have a sprint planning meeting where we plan out our sprint and determine the sprint backlog
	- We have a daily stand up
	- We have a defect triage meeting every afternoon to go over any open defects for fast resolution
	- At the end of the sprint we have a review meeting where we present the work completed to the Product Owner 
	- At the end, we have a Retro to help us improve our team dynamics

3. Explain, in as much detail as possible, the bug life cycle.
	- Tester finds a bug and verifies that it is a valid bug
	- Tester logs it in ALM. Assigns it to the Dev Team
	- Dev can do 1 of 3 things:
		1. Accept the defect and begin working on the fix
		2. Reject the defect as being invalid
		3. Deffer the defect to be worked on later
	- If accepted, the dev begins working on the fix and then delivers the fix to the Testing team
	- Tester re-tests the defect and validates that the bug is fixed. If not fixed, tester sends the bug back to the dev 
	- When fixed, tester closes the defect and passes the test case
	
	- Throughout the bug life cycle, Defect Triage meetings take place every day around 4:00pm to discuss any open bugs and when they will be fixed. 

4. What are the steps to create a test case in ALM? 
	3 ways:
		1. Creating test cases directly in Test Plan
			A. In Test Plan -> Create a New Test Case
			B. Under the Design Steps Tab -> add the test steps
				1. Add Parameters from the Parameters Tab if/when necessary
				2. Incoroporate Template Tests if/when necessary for common steps
			C. Under the Req. Coverage Tab -> Map the test case to the Requirement
		2. Converting the requirements into test cases
			A. In The Requirements Section -> Requirements -> Convert to Tests
			B. Select the Conversion Method
			C. Confirm the Path (where the test cases will be located)
			D. Convert and verify the tests have been created in Test Plan Section
		3. Import from Excel the test cases 
			A. Create the test cases in Excel
			B. Using the Excel-ALM Add-in, log into ALM via Excel
			C. Perform the Mapping (Columns in Excel to Fields in ALM)
			D. Click on Validate
			E. Click on Export and verify the tests have been exported into Test Plan 


5. In your previous Scrum Environments, how did your team handle Epics?
	
	- In our Scrum, we have a grooming meeting every Tuesday and Thursday afternoons
	- Here, we discuss any questions we might have regarding the user stories that the Product Owner has broken down for us
	- We also provide estimated LOE for various user stories so that we can better plan our sprints
